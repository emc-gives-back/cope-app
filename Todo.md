# TODO

* especially for the hackathon structure project into separate modules that contain templates, assets, etc.
* define server-backend to store custom user assets and configuration
    * should be protected by username/password
    * something simple like a key/value or document store, but for multiple users
        * i.e. each user has its own collection of key/values or documents
